   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/eoffermann/AuRA_Avatars_old.git
   cd AuRA_Avatars_old
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed, and then run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Launch the Application**:

### Usage

- **Customize Avatars**:
  - Use the dropdowns in the Gradio interface to set attributes like age, hair color, clothing type, and background objects.
  - Adjust video settings such as resolution, frame rate, and number of frames.

- **Generate Content**:
  - Click the "Generate Avatars" button to produce your avatar video or image.
  - Outputs are saved to the `outputs` directory by default.

- **Command-Line Usage**:
  - Run the pipeline directly with custom parameters:
